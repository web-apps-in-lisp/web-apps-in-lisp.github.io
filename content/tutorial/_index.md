Are you ready to build a web app in Common Lisp?

In this first tutorial we will build a simple app that shows a web
form that will search and display a list of products.

In doing so, we will see many necessary building blocks to write web apps in Lisp:

- how to start a server
- how to create routes
- how to define and use path and URL parameters
- how to define HTML templates
- how to run and build the app, from our editor and from the terminal.

In doing so, we'll experience the interactive nature of Common Lisp
and we'll learn important commands: running `sbcl` from the command
line with a couple options, what is `load`, how to interactively
compile our app with a keyboard shortcut, how to structure a project
with an .asd definition and a package, etc.

We expect that you have Quicklisp installed. If not, please see the [Cookbook: getting started](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html).

Now [let's get started](/tutorial/getting-started/).

But beware. There is no going back.
