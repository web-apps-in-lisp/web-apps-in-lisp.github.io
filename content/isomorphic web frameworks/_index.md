We'll see first: Reblocks.

Weblocks was an old framework developed by Slava Akhmechet, Stephen
Compall and Leslie Polzer. After nine calm years, it saw a very
active update, refactoring and rewrite effort by Alexander Artemenko.
This active project is named Reblocks.

The [Ultralisp](http://ultralisp.org/) website is an example Reblocks
website in production known in the CL community.

It isn't the only solution that aims at making writing interactive web apps easier, where the client logic can be brought to the back-end. See also:

- [ISSR](https://github.com/interactive-ssr/issr-server)

Of course, a special mention goes to [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), which
is language agnostic and backend agnostic. It works well with Common Lisp.
