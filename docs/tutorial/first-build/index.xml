At the first step, we opened a REPL and since then, without noticing, we have compiled variables and function definitions pieces by pieces, step by step, with keyboard shortcuts giving immediate feedback, testing our progress on the go, running a function in the REPL or refreshing the browser window.
Info We didnâ€™t have to restart any Lisp process, nor any web server.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="http://example.org/tutorial/first-build/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
