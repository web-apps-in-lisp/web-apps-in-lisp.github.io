Info We are re-using content we contributed to the Cookbook.
Deploying manually We can start our executable in a shell and send it to the background (C-z bg), or run it inside a tmux session. These are not the best but hey, it works©.
Here’s a tmux crashcourse:
start a tmux session with tmux inside a session, C-b is tmux’s modifier key. use C-b c to create a new tab, C-b n and C-b p for “next” and “previous” tab/window. use C-b d to detach tmux and come back to your original console. Everything you started in tmux still runs in the background. use C-g to cancel a current prompt (as in Emacs). tmux ls lists the running tmux sessions. tmux attach goes back to a running session. tmux attach -t &lt;name> attaches to the session named “name”. inside a session, use C-b $ to name the current session, so you can see it with tmux ls. Here’s a cheatsheet that was handy.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="http://example.org/building-blocks/deployment/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
