You can not only inspect the running program, but also compile and load new code, including installing new libraries, effectively doing hot code reload. It’s up to you to decide to do it or to follow the industry’s best practices. It isn’t because you use Common Lisp that you have to make your deployed program a “big ball of mud”.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="http://example.org/building-blocks/remote-debugging/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
